      <p>John Davis is my name and web dev is the game. My journey started in the "business world" working in customer service and inside sales. During this time I realized 
        that my creativity was not meant to be confined by gray cubicle walls and mundane tasks. Therefore I embarked upon a journey to reinvent myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now seek a new, creative, career in the world of web developmet. When I am not trying to change my life, I waste my time playing 
        video games. Once I feel that it is time to leave a computer screen I head out to the links and remind myself that I am not
        good at golf. That being said I do still dream of playing on the PGA tour, but whats life without dreams right?
